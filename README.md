This is a website that uses open api keys to generate prompts and images from gpt.
The API keys provided in the code are accessible only till november 1st.
After that if you want to access the website change the API keys in the env.js file.
To use the code use the live server extension on Visual Studio code and the code will run automatically.
Once the webpage opens, enter a city or country name and you will get tourist spots in that places with their ratings and an image of the place the user typed.
